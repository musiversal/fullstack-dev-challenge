=== musiversal challenge  ===

Description:

We want to build a quick landing page for a fake tool to bring people on our mission of making anybody a music creator.

The designs and a bit of the interaction of what this DAW will include is in the following figma:

https://www.figma.com/proto/AqxK1uf2tUN12VBFrFmzXn/FE-Exercise?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A238&viewport=931%2C3306%2C1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A238

The task:
- You will have to create a frontend app using ReactJS
- The app will play a video within a modal. The video is hardcoded and it is https://vimeo.com/667840546
- The app will contain a email capture function. We will have to create a simple backend to store that information.
- The Backend should be done using NodeJS, but you can use express or any framework to get the endpoints easier and faster. We could also use sqlite to avoid the need of using another DB, but it is your choice after all.

- All assets are provided in figma
- We need a README.md with launch/setup instructions, any technical choices you have made (which ones and why), additional features you added, known bugs or features that you would have add into the DAW.
- Upload the code into a github/gitlab repo.
- Some basic knowledge on unit tests is required. It doesn't mean you everything has to be tested, but we want to know you know your way around tests.
- You can use any open source libraries as long as you specify why in the readme.
- If you have any additional question please send us an email.
